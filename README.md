> On this day, I have decided to pause the course until some time in the future. Having gone through 64 days of content in 56 days, and with exams only a fortnight away, I will need to put this off for the time being so as to focus on my exams. I might be back after it's all over, I don't know exactly when

> On this day I have resumed the course, starting from day 65. I will continue on with this course each day from now on, until the course is completely finished. I have decided to do another 60 days challenge from today onward and I will keep updating this repository until it is officially done.

## Introduction to this Repository

This repo was created to track my python progress since I started the 100 Days to Python Mastery Udemy course. The idea behind starting this daily streak was due to a 60 Days of Learning challenge I came across. A lot of people around me were taking a part in it, so I thought I may as well.
I can definitely say that by the completion of 64 days of these courses, I feel a lot more confident in a lot of different areas when it comes to Python, as well as when it comes to coding as a whole. I hope this repository serves as a motivational factor for my future endeavours as well.
That is all I have for now.
The projects I completed within this time frame are all within the respective day's folders.
In a future revision to the course, I may remove the virtual environment files that are taking up unnecessary space in the repo.
Until next time!
