# Learning Python: 100 Days of Code

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10-blue)

## Introduction

This repo tracks my journey through the [100 Days of Code: Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Udemy. The initial motivation for this repo was a 60 Days of Learning challenge I started. At the end of the challenge, I paused, having completed upto day 64 of the course, some days included multiple course days. I continued a year later with another 60 Days challenge.
The repository serves as an archive for myself, as well as a source of motivation/inspiration for anyone who wishes to dive into python.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into folders/files for each day of learning. Some days (upto day 15) have a single .py file and thus lie directly on the root. The rest of the work is arranged by the day (according to the course). The structure follows:

-   day-1-print-input-variables.py
-   ...
-   ./day-7-hangman/
-   ...

## 🏃‍➡️ How To Run

### **Step 1:** Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aruncbhusal/learning-python.git
```

### **Step 2:**

#### a. For files/folders without .venv

Most folders contain main.py which is the primary file unless multiple independent files exist for the same day. Open the file in a text editor for clarity. (eg.)

```bash
cd day-7-hangman
python main.py
```

#### b. For folders with .venv

Some folders (eg. Flask projects) have .venv folders. Activate the environment and install dependencies before running: (eg.)

```bash
cd day-61-Flask-WTForms
.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

#### c. For folders with .ipynb

Open .ipynb files in Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab or others. Install dependencies as necessary.
