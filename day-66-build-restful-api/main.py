# The client makes a request to the server, it may be a HTTP request, FTP request or other type of request and the server sees it
# Then it checks if the request can be fulfilled, and if it can't it returns an error code
# If it can fulfill the request, it accesses the database and/or processes the request and gives the client its requested information
# The API bridges this gap between client and server, anad RESTful API is just a architecture for it
# There are other architectures like SOAP, GraphQL, Falcor, etc, but REST is the predominant one for webAPI
# This API was a result of Roy Fielding's PHD research, in order to make the web requests consistent
# The rules to make an API RESTful are: use HTTP request verbs, and use specific pattern of routes/endpoint URLs

# HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
# The routes may be something like /topic to make changes to entire topic, or add a single subtopic to it, and /topic/subtopic to make changes to the subtopic only
# The difference between PUT and PATCH is that PUT updates the entire object in question, but PATCH only changes a single(or more) attribute/value that actually needs to be fixed.
# Using PATCH reduces the bandwidth spent in correcting a piece of data.

# In today's challenge we need to build an API for a website that gives out cafes in London
# The database is given,, its model and table is created already for us and the empty flask app is set up
# Now our job is to follow the instructions and complete the project
